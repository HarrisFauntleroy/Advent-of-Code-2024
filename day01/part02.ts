/**
 * Calculates a similarity score by finding matching numbers between arrays.
 * For each number in the left array, multiplies it by how many times it appears in the right array. The sum of these products is the similarity score.
 * 
 * @example
 * similarityScore([[3,4], [4,3], [3,3]]) // returns 16
 * First 3: appears twice on right side: 3 * 2 = 6
 * 4: appears once on right side: 4 * 1 = 4
 * Second 3: appears twice on right side: 3 * 2 = 6
 * Total score = 16
 * 
 * @param locationIds Array of number pairs to compare
 * @returns Sum of (left number Ã— frequency in right array) for all left numbers
